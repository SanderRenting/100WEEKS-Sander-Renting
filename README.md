# 100WEEKS-Sander-Renting
This guthub page exists out of two .ipynb files. One is called final code 100WEEKS pipeline, which is the code for the 100WEEKS organization. First the central database needs to be uploaded. This can be done by pressing the folder icon on the left hand side and pressing the upload icon (most left icon), wait till it is uploaded (can be seen in the left bottom corner).The next step is choosing the country and running the code on top. The final code needs to be runned afterwards and then the Excel file will appear on the left hand side.

The other file, called 100WEEKS Sander Renting, shows the different steps taken in the process of the coding. It goes through the sections Filtering, Modelling, Evaluating and Results
